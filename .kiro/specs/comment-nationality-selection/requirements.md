# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the comment system by allowing users to set their nationality directly when writing comments, rather than only through the profile page. It also improves the display of nationality information by adding country flag emojis and expanding the available country options to provide better representation for users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user writing a comment, I want to be able to set my nationality directly in the comment creation interface, so that I don't have to navigate to my profile page first.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the comment creation interface THEN the system SHALL display a nationality selection dropdown alongside the comment text input
2. WHEN a user selects a nationality from the dropdown THEN the system SHALL update their profile nationality for future comments
3. WHEN a user has previously set a nationality THEN the system SHALL pre-select that nationality in the dropdown
4. WHEN a user submits a comment with a selected nationality THEN the system SHALL save both the comment and the nationality preference
5. IF a user chooses not to select a nationality THEN the system SHALL allow comment submission without nationality information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user viewing comments, I want to see country flag emojis next to nationality information, so that I can quickly identify the commenter's country visually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying a comment with nationality information THEN the system SHALL show the corresponding country flag emoji next to the country name
2. WHEN a comment has no nationality information THEN the system SHALL display only the comment without any flag or nationality indicator
3. WHEN displaying nationality in the results analytics THEN the system SHALL include flag emojis alongside country names
4. WHEN showing nationality breakdowns THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing privacy rule of minimum 5 users per country

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user from any country, I want to have a comprehensive list of countries to choose from, so that I can accurately represent my nationality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the nationality selection dropdown THEN the system SHALL display a comprehensive list of countries including major nations from all continents
2. WHEN the country list is displayed THEN the system SHALL include at least 50 major countries with proper country names
3. WHEN countries are listed THEN the system SHALL sort them alphabetically for easy navigation
4. WHEN a user searches or scrolls through countries THEN the system SHALL provide a smooth user experience with proper loading states
5. WHEN the system displays country options THEN it SHALL use standardized country names and flag emojis

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the nationality selection to be consistent across the comment creation and profile pages, so that I have a unified experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sets nationality in the comment creation interface THEN the system SHALL update their profile nationality to match
2. WHEN a user changes nationality in their profile THEN the system SHALL use that nationality as the default for future comments
3. WHEN displaying nationality selection interfaces THEN the system SHALL use the same country list and flag display format
4. WHEN a user has set nationality in either location THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency across all nationality displays
