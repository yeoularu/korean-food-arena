# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the comment visibility system in the Korean Food ELO Ranking application. Currently, users can only see comments from people who voted on the exact same food pairing. This enhancement will expand comment visibility to show comments from users who voted for either of the two foods in the current pairing, regardless of what the other food in their pairing was.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user who just voted on a food pairing, I want to see comments from people who voted for either of the two foods I'm comparing, so that I can read diverse opinions about these specific foods from a broader range of users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user completes a vote on a food pairing (A vs B) THEN the system SHALL display comments from users who voted for food A in any pairing
2. WHEN a user completes a vote on a food pairing (A vs B) THEN the system SHALL display comments from users who voted for food B in any pairing
3. WHEN displaying expanded comments THEN the system SHALL show which specific food the commenter voted for
4. WHEN displaying expanded comments THEN the system SHALL show what the other food in the commenter's pairing was
5. WHEN displaying expanded comments THEN the system SHALL maintain the same privacy protections for nationality data (minimum group size of 5)
6. WHEN displaying expanded comments THEN the system SHALL continue to require that the current user has voted on their current pairing before viewing any comments

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user viewing comments, I want to understand the context of each comment, so that I can better interpret the opinions and experiences shared by other users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comments are displayed THEN each comment SHALL show the food that the commenter voted for
2. WHEN comments are displayed THEN each comment SHALL show the other food that was in the commenter's comparison
3. WHEN comments are displayed THEN each comment SHALL indicate whether the commenter voted for a win or tie
4. WHEN comments are displayed THEN the system SHALL clearly distinguish between comments from the current pairing vs comments from other pairings
5. WHEN comments are displayed THEN the system SHALL sort comments with current pairing comments first, followed by expanded comments
6. WHEN comments are displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain chronological ordering within each group (current pairing vs expanded)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the expanded comment system to maintain performance and usability, so that the enhanced functionality doesn't negatively impact my experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN expanded comments are loaded THEN the system SHALL limit the total number of comments displayed to prevent performance issues
2. WHEN expanded comments are loaded THEN the system SHALL prioritize comments from the current exact pairing over expanded comments
3. WHEN expanded comments are loaded THEN the system SHALL implement pagination to handle large numbers of comments
4. WHEN expanded comments are loaded THEN the system SHALL maintain reasonable response times (under 2 seconds)
5. WHEN expanded comments are loaded THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual indicators to distinguish comment types
6. WHEN expanded comments are loaded THEN the system SHALL allow users to filter between current pairing comments and expanded comments

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the expanded comment system to maintain data integrity and security, so that the enhancement doesn't introduce vulnerabilities or performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN expanded comments are queried THEN the system SHALL use efficient database queries with proper indexing
2. WHEN expanded comments are queried THEN the system SHALL maintain the same access control requirements (user must have voted)
3. WHEN expanded comments are queried THEN the system SHALL apply the same nationality privacy protections across all displayed comments
4. WHEN expanded comments are queried THEN the system SHALL prevent SQL injection and other security vulnerabilities
5. WHEN expanded comments are queried THEN the system SHALL handle edge cases gracefully (no comments, single food, etc.)
6. WHEN expanded comments are queried THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing comment functionality
